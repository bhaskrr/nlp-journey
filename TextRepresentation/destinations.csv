Balpakram,SOUTH GARO HILLS,"Balpakram, ‘the land of perpetual winds’, may not be well-known to the outside world but it is an important part of Garo folklore. Its unchartered jungles, massive cliffs, and powerful rivers have birthed many stories of the paranormal type, including that of the stalking ‘mandeburung’, or man of the jungle, straight out of the cryptozoologist’s handbook. If these tales don’t inspire you to tread through its forest paths, Balpakram National Park is also a treasure trove of animal and plant life, including the endangered wild water buffalo. Designated as the land of the spirits by local lore, a Balpakram experience blends the natural with the mystical. As you travel along the scenic Garo countryside, watch out for the surprises along the way – including an abundance of pitcher plants, an insectivorous enigma that will interest any botanist. The mighty Simsang River defines the landscape. On the plateau-top, you will get expansive views of the National Park’s main canyon and the many waterfalls that barrage down from the cliff-side. Despite its comparatively small size, Balpakram is considered the last stand of the rarest plant and animal species not found anywhere else.

You begin at the tip of the valley close to the village of Tyrna and climb down approximately 3000 steps. On the way, there are plenty of stunning vistas and natural sights to soak in. The root bridges of Meghalaya are an enigma, an integral part of the old Khasi lifestyle that dates back to the times when trekking through thick forests and negotiating fast-flowing rivers was a part of the routine.

Mawsynram,EAST KHASI HILLS,"Ever thought of a place where waterfalls are so plentiful that they become a nuisance? That can be the scene on the highway to the famed town of Mawsynram when your vehicle might just have to drive right through a monsoon cascade falling from the mountainside.
The Mawsynram plateau region has received enough attention for its world-record rainfall but there are many more unique sights here. Krem Puri is the longest sandstone cave in the world. Getting to the entry requires a steep descent down one of the valley slopes. The labyrinth has just been recently mapped and visitors need to go in with proper caving gear and with a local guide.

Mawlynnong Village,EAST KHASI HILLS,"Mawlynnong has earned a reputation for being one of the cleanest villages in Asia, but a sobriquet that does more justice is that of God’s Own Garden. The fruit orchards, the rushing streams, the evergreen surroundings, the swaying palms, and the well-preserved traditions of the Khasis provide a picture-perfect stage on the edge of Meghalaya’s southern ranges. Arguably the most famous icon of Meghalaya is found here – the Nohwet Living Root Bridge. The bridge was created by weaving the roots of the Ficus Elastica tree around a framework and continuing this process for generations. These living root bridges are a staple of Khasi traditional architecture and were important for the villages in the steep valleys and mountains, helping the people connect with each other and travel to the plains to trade. These fascinating bridges are built in harmony with nature and get stronger as they grow older. After admiring the bridge, you can also take a dip in the gushing, cool waters of the river. The living root bridge of Nohwet is not the only main attraction here. The Church of the Epiphany in Mawlynnong is more than a century old, a beautiful piece of European architecture tucked in the middle of this lush and verdant tropical paradise.

The pool at the bottom of the falls is a tranquil spot where you can wade into the clear water at knee-level and get a nice picture with the giant cascade in the background. The Khasi name for Elephant Falls is Kshaid-Lai-Pateng, which roughly refers to the three levels over which the water plunges.

Shillong Heritage Walk,East Khasi Hills,"Shillong was made the capital of the Assam Province under the British in September 1874. It remained the administrative capital of the State of Assam even after India’s Independence up until 1972 when Meghalaya achieved statehood. The agreeable climate of Shillong, with the occasional rain and showers, was ideal for the British administrators and soldiers to recoup their health and spirits after the sweltering heat and dust of the plains. The British saw Shillong as ‘a chip off the British Isles’ and they put in a lot of their resources in developing the hill station of Shillong into an administrative and leisure retreat.

Nartiang Durga Temple,West Jaintia Hills,"What today might come across as a sleepy town used to the trail of tourists, Nartiang was once an important cultural and spiritual centre during the peak of the Jaintia kingdom. It is also home to the famous Nartiang Durga Temple. The Durga temple here is built on the site of an older one and fascinating stories emerge as you dig around and learn about the history of the place.

Dainthlen Falls,EAST KHASI HILLS,"Dainthlen is one of the most powerful sights you will come across, a gushing waterfall that cuts through the hard rocks and the high plateau of Sohra before it cascades down into lush forests. It is also a culturally significant place for the Khasi tribe. During the drier seasons, you will be able to negotiate the hard, rocky pot-holed river bed leading to the falls. According to local folktales, this spot is where a great battle was fought. The Thlen was a giant serpent, an embodiment of evil who was finally vanquished by the local residents of an ancient village that is now Sohra. The thundering sound of the Dainthlen Falls, the open landscape, the surrounding hillocks, and the capricious winds that constantly blow here provide an apt setting for such a grand legend. The Dainthlen Falls is a straight drop of around 80 metres. The viewpoint is on either side of the falls so you can see its natural splendour from up close behind the safety of a railing. You will also enjoy exploring the terrain around Dainthlen on foot. From wandering cows to rare birds, there are many surprises in store as you find your way along the gentle grassy rises and dips, punctuated by little hills and streams. Getting to Dainthlen Falls and Nearby Attractions – If you are travelling from Shillong, Dainthlen Falls requires a short detour just before you enter the town of Sohra (Cherrapunjee). On the way, there are many scenic places where you can stop and soak in the sights. Resorts and picnic areas are also available in the surrounding area.

Mawsmai Cave,EAST KHASI HILLS,"You do not have to be a professional spelunker to get a taste of Meghalaya’s cave systems. Mawsmai Cave is located at a short distance from Sohra and is an easy attraction to access and explore. There are some places inside the cave where you will need to squeeze around and crawl – and this adds to the experience of cave exploration. The Mawsmai cave route that is accessible to tourists is not very long and is very safe so you do not want to miss out on this unique opportunity. The cave is also famous for its fossils, some which you can spot if you spend some time peering at the walls and formations inside. The ten longest caves (and more) in the country are all in Meghalaya. These subterranean networks spread across the southern ranges like a complex network of routes formed by the erosion of limestone and unrelenting flow of water. Mawsmai offers a glimpse into this fascinating world underneath our feet. The approach to the Mawsmai caves is a pleasant one – a short walk through a thickly wooded area which is constantly filled with the chirps of birds and creaking of insects. Many travellers like to relax or take a stroll in the surrounding forests after they have visited the cave. Getting to Mawsmai Cave – The busy and scenic Shillong-Sohra road will get you to Mawsmai. Leave behind the undulating meadows and travel on the edge of vast canyons with dense vegetation. A stop at Mawkdok is recommended for a quick chai and spectacular views. Ziplining facilities are also available at this favoured pit stop.",Sohra,"Nature, Sightseeing, Caving, Photography, Hiking"
Noh Ka Likai Falls,EAST KHASI HILLS,"A straight plunge of over 1000 feet gives Noh Ka Likai superlative status amongst waterfalls in India. Located on the southern ridges of the state, it provides a mesmerizing scene with the backdrop of the dramatic cliffs and the deep pool and thick forests at the bottom. Formed from the many streams that have carved through Meghalaya’s highlands for millions of years, Noh Ka Likai has a bigger significance culturally – it bears a most tragic story that is still told today. Noh Ka Likai is an even more impressive sight up close. One can hike to the head of the waterfalls and enjoy the scenery of the valley through a large door-like opening in the rocks, something out of a medieval fantasy novel. There are treks through the dense forests that will take you to the bottom of the falls. Make sure you use a guide – apart from the assurance of being with a local expert, you will also enjoy the immense knowledge the residents of the nearby villages have about their forests. These treks also take you through an incredible change of terrain and vegetation – from the higher grasslands with hardy trees to the steaming tropical havens at lower elevations – all in a few hours.",Sohra,"Nature, Sightseeing"
Noh Sngithiang Falls,EAST KHASI HILLS,"There are not too many reasons why you would go out when it rains but the monsoons in Sohra turn that notion on its head. With a drop of more than 300 metres, Noh Sngi Thiang is one of the most impressive waterfalls you will see anywhere in India. Like a majestic jewel draped over the limestone cliffs, it is segmented into seven parts which drop into the misty forested plains. Because of this unique segmented formation, the falls are also popularly referred to as the Seven Sisters Falls. Shutterbugs will love to spend entire days charting the different hues created because of the sunlight and the waters – the sunsets here are considered very special. The landscape is a distinctive one as the tabletop heights of the plateau abruptly end into a massive drop and you get a seat right on the edge. Close to the Noh Sngithiang Falls is the Sohra Eco Park, a pleasant stop which provides the best vantage points if you want to admire the waterfalls, verdant canyons and lush slopes of Sohra. An interesting highlight in this park is a stream with a bridge over it that you need to cross to catch the views. Beyond the southern ranges of Meghalaya, one can also catch amazing views of the Bangladesh plains in fine detail, especially when the clouds clear away. Getting to Nongsngithiang Falls – If you are travelling from Shillong, it is easy to get distracted on the way to Nongsngithiang Falls. This natural attraction is usually bunched with a longer sightseeing itinerary that includes spots like Mawsmai Caves, Noh Ka Likai Falls, and Khoh Ramhah. Many travellers like to stop at the scenic Mawkdok Bridge which is at around the halfway point of your short, picturesque drive.",Sohra,"Nature, Sightseeing, Photography"
"Khat-ar-shnong, Kongthong",East Khasi Hills,"Getting to Khat-ar-shnong itself is a memorable experience – as the roads hug the mountainside while you glance at the gorges below from your ride. Khat-ar-shnong refers to a valley region in East Khasi Hills, which has been isolated for a long time due to the terrain. Kongthong is the most prominent village because of its striking location and its unique tradition where residents of the village are assigned a tune that also serves as a unique ID. The residents of the Kongthong, known as the Whistling Village along with people from the nearby villages have been practising this tradition which is called the ‘jingrwai iawbei’ for generations. This distinctive cultural practice is not the only reason to set up base in Kongthong. The scenic beauty here is mesmerizing as you will be surrounded by the mighty monsoon mountains of Meghalaya and many trails can be enjoyed. Khat-ar-shnong is where you will find the highest living root bridge, the Jingkieng Myor that connects two granite cliffs with the rushing Wah Sohra river more than a hundred feet below. This region is also famous for its honey. Other prominent villages and spots in Khat-ar-shnong include Mawrah viewpoint, Khrang village (famous for its krot herbal tea), Dewlieh and many more spots.

Pynursla,East Khasi Hills,"Visitors in Meghalaya often overlook the Pynursla region because it falls enroute to the more chronicled destinations of Dawki and Mawlynnong but this heavily forested region characterized by steep gradients and scenic roadways has many amazing secrets of its own. Mawkyrnot village here is home to multiple root bridges, which can be accessed via a short comfortable hike through the quiet, primaeval forest. The diversity of landscapes in Pynursla will stun you. From the lush, humid jungles of the slopes, you can head over to the plateau grasslands and soak in the charming pine-dotted countryside at Langkawet, known for its small lakes. Rangthylliang village is another starting point for those who want to venture for a jungle camping trip. Pynursla is a good place to chase waterfalls – the stunning Wah Rymben Falls has few visitors so it can be an offbeat addition to your list – it involves a short descent from Lapalang village. Apart from being the land of living root bridges, Pynursla region is famous for its fruits and jungle produce. Make sure you grab a bag of the famous oranges here if you happen to visit in winter.",Pynursla,"Hiking, Trekking, Camping, Culture, Living Root Bridges, Scenery"
Marngar Lake,RI-BHOI,"Marngar Lake is a charming water body located in the lush, green hills of Bhoi and is a favourite for picnickers and those seeking a quiet place to enjoy some nice views and fresh air.

Weinia Falls,West Khasi Hills,"Plunging from a height of around a thousand feet, the Weinia Falls is one of Meghalaya’s many hidden treasures. Apart from the imposing cascades, the rather untouched and isolated natural location also brings cheers to nature enthusiasts and those looking for a quiet time off the beaten path. The roar of the falls can be heard from a distance and the flow is incredibly powerful especially during the monsoons and the following months, when the Kynshi River swells. The Weinia Falls provides a distinctive picture because of a double-arched bridge in the background and its spray from its pool fills up the entire valley. A path created on the side of the falls for visitors allows you to follow the flow of the water and get nice views of the forests below. To get here you will have to visit the magical Nongkhnum River Island, the location where the fast-flowing Kynshi River splits into two. The island is loaded with plenty of other attractions, including a splendid river beach.

Lum Sohpetbneng,RI-BHOI,"Catch up on some local lore before you head over to the dramatic Lum Sohpetbneng, a revered site for the Khasis that is located close to the beautiful Umiam Lake. The Khasis have a fascinating belief system, and their landscape is an important part of their folklore. One of their central stories is that of the umbilical cord, or natural bridge that connected heaven and earth many ages ago that existed on top of this gentle hill – Sohpetbneng translates to the navel of heaven. Because of human pride and sin, this bridge was severed. Every year, the Khasis who practice the indigenous religion make a pilgrimage to the summit to celebrate and acknowledge their legends and to pledge to keep alive their unique traditions. The summit of Lum Sohpetbneng requires a gentle climb. The views of the lake from the top are worth it along with the tranquil, pine-crested surroundings. The base of Lum Sohpetbneng is on the Guwahati-Shillong highway and you will be welcomed by a tall gateway featuring traditional motifs. If you want to watch the crowds for the annual pilgrimage then set your date for the second Sunday of February.

Smit and the larger Nongkrem region is also filled with many nature trails and cycling enthusiasts can connect with local cycling groups to enjoy some exhilarating off-road perspectives. There are many nearby attractions that you can add as detours. If viewpoints are your thing, then Shillong Peak is the most famous one. It provides views of the entire town and is the highest point in the state at 1960 metres above sea level. We like to believe that the observatory deck located here – complete with a telescope – helps us gain a few more metres. Around the peak region, there are some interesting stops and photographers will always find a reason to linger as the terrain shifts from open pine meadows to sub-tropical repeatedly, interrupted by neat patterns of vegetable cultivations. Accommodation in Shillong town would be ideal for a Smit trip because of the proximity but if you want to have a more rustic getaway we would suggest you choose one of many upcoming homestays in and around Smit and Nongkrem region.",Smit,"Scenic Drives, Culture, Treks, Nature, Adventure"
